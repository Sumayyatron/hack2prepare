We're developing this as part of our partnership with Code For America, for Code for America brigades who want to run 1-2 day events for the purpose of recruiting new brigade members, for hackathons, or for kickstarting new projects within their brigades. \r\n\r\n### Get Started \r\n\r\nAs a first step to running a Hackshop event, we recommend forking this repository, editing the README to be specific to your event. Then go to Settings-> GitHub Automatic Page Generator and loading your repository's README.md to stand up a quick website for your event. \r\n\r\n### Examples \r\nSee [HackshopNC](http://waffleio.github.io/hackshopNC/) for an example from our pilot event. \r\n\r\n### This is a work in progress\r\n*Note that this playbook is in beta, and is a work in progress. As we continue to run hackshops and spread the word to Code for America brigades, we'll be iterating and expanding on the content.*\r\n\r\n### Table of Contents\r\n- [About Hackshops](/about.md) \r\n- [Recommended Tools](/tools.md) \r\n- [Process](/process.md)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Sample content for forks ---\r\n\r\n<img width=\"327\" alt=\"screen shot 2015-09-09 at 5 03 26 pm\" src=\"https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/100216/9774168/b86355c8-5714-11e5-993e-395f1fb8c43c.png\">\r\n# Getting Started\r\n- [Create Free Account at Github.com](http://github.com)\r\n- [Create Free Account at Waffle.io](http://waffle.io)\r\n- [Kick off Your Project at Hackshop.waffle.io](http://hackshop.waffle.io)\r\n- Join our chatroom\r\n- Lean Canvas (Provided to teams)\r\n- Use [Hackpad](http://hackpad.com) to Document Your Team and Problem\r\n\r\n\r\n# Event Information\r\n\r\nJoin us for a Hackshop-- part hackathon, part lean workshop. \r\n\r\nThroughout the course of the event, teams will be guided through a lightweight framework guided by Hackshop organizers that instills principles of running lean and maximizing limited resources using elements of agile and lean startup principles.
